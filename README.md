- **Define the bet structure**: Create a struct to represent a bet. This structure should contain the user's address, the amount bet, and the selected option (ethlow, range, or ethup).

- **Implement the betting functionality**: Create a function that allows users to place their bets. The function should take the user's address, the bet amount, and the selected option as parameters. Store the bet in a mapping, using the user's address as the key.

- **Retrieve the ETH/USD price**: Create a function that requests the current ETH/USD price from Chainlink. This function should call the Chainlink contract's requestPrice function with the necessary parameters (Oracle address, Job ID, etc.).

- **Settle the bets**: After the 30-day timestamp has passed, create a function that settles the bets. This function should retrieve the final ETH/USD price using Chainlink and calculate the result of each bet based on the selected option and the price.

- **Distribute the winnings**: Once the bets are settled, distribute the winnings to the users who placed winning bets. Transfer the appropriate amount of funds from the contract's balance to each winning user.
